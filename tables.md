# Tables 

You can create tables easily with markdown:

| Name | Occupation | Favourite lolly | 
|----|----|----|
| Michaela | Confused | Anything |
| Anna | Possum exterminator | Strawberry |

Some tip(s):
* Align columns using : on the line below the header line 
* to the left is nothing, to the right is : on the right hand side, centered is : : one on either side 
* note: tables are not official markdown, so might not always work this way using markdown in other places i.e. R 

| Name | Occupation | Favourite lolly | 
|----|----:|:----:|
| Michaela | Confused | Anything |
| Anna | Possum exterminator | Strawberry |
